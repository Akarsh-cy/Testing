Topic: ECOLOGY

Lets start with a simple question what is ecology?

[On slide write What is ecology?]

Well ecology is the scintific study of interactions.
Its about how living organisms-that's plants 
and animals interact with each other.

[On slide write/diagram of food web]
[On slide write/diagram of animals living in same ha
bitat(a pond with ducks,fishes,mosquitos ,snails etc)]

and there envirnoment like sunlight,water etc interact.

The word itself comes from the greek word oikos meaning house.
So think of ecology as a study of our planet as a house where organisms share resources and affect one another

in short ,ecology isnt just a part of envirnoment science,
its the foundation for understanding how life on earth functions.

Topic: Levels of ecology

Now that we know what ecology is,lets look at how ecologits study it.

At the smallest level,we start with an organism-a simple living thing like one squirrel.

[On slide show a individual animal  ]

Zoom out,and we see a population that is group of same species living together.

[On slide show many individuals of same speciees in an envirnoment]

zooming our further we find a community ,this is where it gets interesting,
This is where all the differnt populatikns like insects,squirels hawks interact.

[On slide show many different differnt species in same habitat(ecosystem)can 
also show differnt ecosystems like aquatic etc]

the next level is ecosystem. this includes living communityalong with there habitat
,water air etc.
And finally zooming all the way out we get Biosphere the sum of all ecosystems ,
the thin layer aroubd earth where all life exists.
